                    I need to drive to town today to get some
                    shopping done but I need to know what the weather
                    is like right now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I plan on going camping later this week but I
                    don't know what the weather is going to be like.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm wondering if I should walk my dog in the
                    morning or in the afternoon but I don't know when
                    it is going to rain today.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm wondering if I should go to the football or
                    just watch it on TV, I just really don't want to
                    get stuck in the rain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm wondering if I should have the kids walk to
                    school or if I should drive them there. I don't
                    want them walking in a thunderstorm.
