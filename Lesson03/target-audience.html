            <ul>
                <li>
                    My younger sibling is nervous about storms. I need
                    information to show that weather is not that severe here,
                    and that it can be fun.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I plan on going cloud watching as a date and I need
                    a rough time-table.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am writting a novel and i need to know what the worst
                    snow storm in Idaho was in the last hundred years to base 
                    a plot point off of.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I saw a weather channel documentry today. They made some
                    incredable claims. I want to know more about this becuse
                    it sounds neat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The farmers say that last year was the worst snowstorm of 
                    the century. I don't belive that, and I would like to know 
                    if they are correct.
