          <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
          <p>The Microsoft Store</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">https://www.microsoft.com/</a>
          </p>
          <img

            alt="Microsoft Store Screenshot"
          />
          <p>
            I choose the Microsoft store for visual hierarchy because the site
            uses it when displaying the products that Microsoft is trying to
            sell. You would see one main product like the surface laptop and
            then below you would then see product like headpoints and software
            that would go work with the surface laptop at a smaller size.

          <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
          <p>The Apple Store</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop">https://www.apple.com/shop</a>
          </p>
          <img src="img/screenshot2-small.jpg" alt="Apple Store Screenshot" />
          <p>
            I choose the Apple store for white space and clean design because
            all of Apple's websites and products follow this very well. If you
            look at each part of the page, you'll see lots of whitespace between
            each part and the design layout is very clean and not cluddered.

          <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
          <p>Raspberry Pi Home Page</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"
              >https://www.raspberrypi.org/</a
            >
          </p>
          <img
            src="img/screenshot3-small.jpg"
            alt="Raspberry Pi Home Page Screenshot"
          />
          <p>
            I choose the Raspberry Pi home page because they have a lot of
            content on the screen and to help make it more navigatable, they
            group links and products together that are more similar or on the
            same topic and they seprate different items or products by putting
            them in different boxs or putting lines between them.
